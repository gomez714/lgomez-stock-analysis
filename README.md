Analysis of Stocks utilizing VBA Macro

#Challenge 

I created a VBA Macro to analyze financial data provided by steve in order to get a better understanding of stock performance.
After performing the analysis, I then refactored the code executed by the macro in order to make it more dynamic in case Steve may want to look at a different set of stocks in the future.
